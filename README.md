# Foxy
An LLVM backed compiled language with simple, easy to learn syntax

## IN DEVELOPMENT!

Everything you see in this repo was created solo by me in 2 weeks so do't expect too much

Foxy so far has syntax like this:
```Foxy
const X: int = 56 // 7 * 5 % 68
import <File_In_include.vpy>
SomeFunction()
# a comment
```

# GOALS
it aims to be as powerful as C/C++, as expresive as python and 100% clear at the same time
To not over estimate my ability and to help myself real this big goal, in TODO.md I have a list of goals to tick off
